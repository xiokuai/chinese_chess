## Introduction

Chinese Chess is a traditional two-player competitive game originating in China, with a long history. Due to its simple equipment and strong entertainment value, it has become a widely popular chess activity.

Chinese Chess is played on a square grid board with circular pieces, totaling 32 pieces. The red and black sides each have 16 pieces, placed and moved on the intersections of the grid lines. The two sides alternate turns, and the side that checkmates the opponent’s General (or Marshal) wins.

## Pieces

There are 32 pieces in total, divided into red and black groups. Each group has 16 pieces with seven types as follows:

Red pieces:
One Marshal (帥), two Chariots (車), two Horses (馬), two Cannons (砲), two Ministers (相), two Advisors (仕), and five Soldiers (兵).

Black pieces:
One General (将), two Chariots (车), two Horses (马), two Cannons (炮), two Elephants (象), two Guards (士), and five Pawns (卒).

## General / Marshal

The red side’s piece is called “Marshal” (帥), the black side’s is “General” (将).

The General or Marshal is the leader in the game and is the main target both sides strive to capture.

It can only move within the "Palace" area. It can move one step vertically or horizontally at a time. The Marshal and General cannot face each other directly on the same file without any pieces in between; if so, the player to move loses.

## Advisor / Guard

The red side has “Advisors” (仕), the black side has “Guards” (士).

They also can only move inside the Palace.

Their movement is restricted to one step diagonally within the Palace.

## Elephant / Minister

Red has “Ministers” (相), black has “Elephants” (象).

They move two points diagonally each time, commonly called “Elephant’s Eye”.

Elephants/Ministers cannot cross the river dividing the two sides, limited to their own half of the board. If the midpoint of their diagonal move is occupied by any piece, the move is blocked, called “blocked elephant’s eye”.

## Chariot / Rook

Red has “Chariots” (車), black has “Rooks” (车).

Chariots are the most powerful pieces, able to move any number of points vertically or horizontally, as long as no piece blocks the path, known as “straight path by Chariot”.

A single Chariot can control up to 17 points on the board, giving rise to the phrase “One Chariot causes ten pieces to shiver”.

## Cannon

Red side’s “Cannons” (砲), black side’s “Cannons” (炮).

Cannons move like Chariots when not capturing. However, when capturing, a Cannon must jump exactly one piece (either friend or foe) between itself and the target, known as “Cannon shooting over a piece” or “jumping the mountain”.

## Horse / Knight

Red has “Horses” (馬), black has “Knights” (马).

The Horse moves in an “L” shape: first one step straight horizontally or vertically, then one step diagonally outward, commonly called “Horse moves like the character ‘日’”.

A Horse can potentially move to eight different points around it, giving rise to the phrase “Eight directions of mighty power”. However, if the first step is blocked by another piece, the Horse cannot move in that direction, called “hobbling the Horse’s leg”.

## Soldier / Pawn

Red has “Soldiers” (兵), black has “Pawns” (卒).

Soldiers (Pawns) can only move forward, never backward. Before crossing the river, they cannot move sideways. After crossing the river, they can move one step left or right as well, but still only one step at a time. Despite this limitation, Soldiers become significantly stronger after crossing the river, leading to the saying “A little Pawn crossing the river can block a big Chariot”.

## Rules of Play

* Players alternate turns moving one piece each turn.
* Moving a piece from one intersection point to another, or capturing an opponent’s piece by occupying its intersection point, counts as one move.
* One turn consists of each side making one move.
* When moving, if an opponent’s piece occupies a reachable point, it can be captured by moving there.
* When a player attacks the opponent’s General (Marshal) and threatens to capture it in the next move, it is called “Check”. There is no need to declare “Check”.
* The side in check must immediately respond to remove the check. If it cannot, it is “Checkmate”.

## Winning and Drawing Conditions

A player loses, and the opponent wins, if:

* Their General (Marshal) is checkmated or captured.
* They have no legal moves (stalemate).

A draw occurs if:

* Both sides reach a simple position where no one can force a win.
* The same position repeats three times, following the official rules concerning repetition.

## Game Modes

The game includes three basic modes, one extended mode, and one hidden (debug) mode:

* Human vs. Computer: Player competes against AI
* Two Players: Two players play on the same device
* Online Mode: Two players play on separate devices over a network
* Endgame Mode (Extended): Load chess files or use the built-in chess library to enter “Endgame Challenge” mode
* Test Mode (Hidden): AI vs. AI for debugging. Launch the program, close the “Select Mode” window, then press “Ctrl + t” to activate.

Finally, start your own battle!
